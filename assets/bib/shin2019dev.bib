ABSTRACT = {Although non-invasive brain stimulation techniques do not involve surgical procedures, the challenge remains in correctly locating the stimulator from outside the head. There is a limit to which one can manually and precisely position and orient the stimulator or repeatedly move the stimulator around the same position. Therefore, in this study, we developed a serial robot with 6 degrees-of-freedom to move the stimulator and a neuro-navigation system to determine the stimulus point from looking at the shape of the subjectâ€™s brain. The proposed robot applied a spherical mechanism while considering the safety of the subject, and the workspace of the robot was designed considering the shape of the human head. Position-based visual servoing was applied to compensate for unexpected movements during subject stimulation. We also developed a neuro-navigation system that allows us visually to check the focus of the stimulator and the human brain at the same time and command the robot to the desired point. To verify the system performance, we first performed repeatability and motion compensation experiments of the robot and then evaluated the repeated biosignal response experiments through transcranial magnetic stimulation, a representative technique of non-invasive brain stimulation.},
