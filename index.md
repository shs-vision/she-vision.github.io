## About Me

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Robotic Cognition & Manipulation Lab](https://rilab.hanyang.ac.kr) in Hanyang University.
I received the B.S. degree in 2015, the M.S. degree in 2017, and the Ph. D. in 2023 in electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Republic of Korea. 
I was a Visiting Scholar at KU Leuven, Belgium in 2020. 
Since 2023, I have been a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Research Institute of Engineering and Technology at Hanyang University, Republic of Korea. 
My research interests focus on developing autonomous systems for advanced capabilities in complex environments including robotic noninvasive brain stimulation, object pose estimation, multi-sensor fusion and robotic grasping.
